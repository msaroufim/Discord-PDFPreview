# PDF Previewer in Discord

## Usage from source

Get a token from https://discord.com/developers/applications and run `export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Then add the bot to your Discord group

I've wrapped up such a token in  Github action if you're not interested in deploying this bot yourself. 

Just invite PDF Preview # 2277 to your channel
